# Airdrop

{% hint style="warning" %}
Airdrop registration is not live yet.
{% endhint %}

Early adopters of the Vultisig wallet security standard are highly valued by the project, so Vultisig wants to give back to these high conviction members.

The future $VULT airdrop will be proportionate to:

$$
vault\_asset\_value*time\_in\_vault
$$

With the distribution date of 12 months after registration goes live.\
See further caluclation [here](airdrop.md#airdrop-process).\
\
Users will receive full information about how to register for this airdrop in the coming weeks.

***

## Airdrop Process

To register their vaults for the Airdrop, users send their exported Vault public Keys to an Airdrop Registry, which will scan for presence of funds on chains, and then begin counting airdrop value. \
See the exact instructions [here.](airdrop.md#how-to-register-for-the-airdrop)\
\
This will include any actions performed in Vultisig (like bonding to nodes and staking, etc.).

A new scan will be performed each cycle (day), and the user airdrop value accumulate in form of VULTIES (Points).\
Users that keep the funds the longest in Vultisig will earn the highest airdrop value.

$$
user\_airdrop\_value += \$\text{total\_vault\_value}
$$

The final share of the Airdrop is the pro-rata share of the airdrop allocation.

$$
\text{user\_airdrop\_share} = 10,000,000 \times \left( \frac{\text{user\_airdrop\_value}}{\text{total\_airdrop\_value}} \right)
$$

### Initial Airdrop

The initial Airdrop is 10,000,000 $VULT, which will be distributed after the first year. After which, all public keys are purged and a new airdrop period begins.

### Ongoing Airdrop

The Ongoing Airdrop Process will continue for another 5 years, and the dedicated supply of $VULT will be airdropped on the anniversary of the token launch every year.
